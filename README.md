# Path-finding-

My current Master Thesis at Queen Mary university Of London involves working with Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Path Finding Algorithms.

My work involves creating a Navigation System for new students at the University which helps them in finding the path to the Destination from the Origin.

Below is a a example of the path found by the chatbot

The algorithms deals with finding the shortest and fastest path by making use of Path Finding Algorithms like AStar,Dijkstra. 

A lot of Image pre-processing needs to be done to segment the Image into Walkable and Non-walkable Paths. Traditional Image Processing techniques like Contours, Dilation, Segmentation, Erosion and Circles were used to clean and pre-process the Image.

Below is an example of CLeaned Image
